            The images acquired at diagnostic centers or hospitals are
            uploaded and transferred digitally to a radiologist expert through
            our system. These radiologists at 5C Network utilize their
            experience and several AI-aided algorithms for interpretation and
            reporting. This remote radiology reporting technique minimizes the
            turnaround time to as low as 24 minutes (yes, we are faster than
            pizza delivery!) maintaining the accuracy of the result.
